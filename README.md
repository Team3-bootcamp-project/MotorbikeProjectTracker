## Description
This is a tracking service for a motorcycle customs shop. Similar to what restaurant delivery services do, but instead of receiving a pizza after 45 minutes or less, you get a customized to your liking motorcycle after a six month wait. It uses the MERN stack and GraphQL for API calls
